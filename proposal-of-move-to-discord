This is meant to be begin a formal PR process for consideration of moving to Discord from Slack as our main community application and form of communication and organization.

See issue: https://github.com/newhavenio/playbooks/issues/1

There are various pros and cons, summarized as something like:

* Discord provides more features
* Discord seems to be growing as a community product
* Slack seems more business focused than community focused
* Scrollback!!!


Cons:

* Some folks will not make the migration
* Learning new moderation tools, managing the new app, etc
* Need to let people know we're moving
* Doing nothing is fine

Anyway. This is not meant to be an inclusive argument for or against, but simply to put forth a source controllable conversation we can look back to and say: This is what we thought, and this is what we decided.

Some organizations have wanted to move for quite some time, but inertia is a powerful force.

Ultimately, the decision will come down to:

What features do we gain from Discord (Scrollback, Voice chat, Screen sharing, Better moderation tools)
vs
What do we lose by moving (Current community, actual members, generational divide, etc.?)

I don't know what form this document should take so this is a first stab at it.
