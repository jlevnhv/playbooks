# Code of Conduct Revisions

We haven't had to make a code of conduct revision since the big overhaul in December of 2019.

Just wanted to get the process down on paper before we make another.

The goal is to keep the community in the fold about proposed changes and let them be part of the discussion and decision making process. IO wouldn't be what it is without its members and we want them to feel heard and know that their input is valued.

Steps:

1. Talk to the board about proposed changes.

2. Write up your changes and submit a PR on https://github.com/newhavenio/code-of-conduct

3. Post in the #general channel and email the Meetup email list about the proposed changes, letting them know about the public comment period.
  3a. The public comment period isn't concrete. The big overhaul was a month to allow for discussion. Smaller changes (like the one in November of 2020) is a week. Use your best judgement.

4. Make changes to the proposed changes based on discussions had in the GitHub PR and in Slack.

5. After the public comment period, merge the PR and let the Slack/Meetup email list know it's been finalized.
